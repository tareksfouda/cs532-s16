The Web has fundamentally changed how we learn, play, communicate, and
work. Its influence has become so monumental that it has given birth to
a new science: Web Science, or the science of decentralized information
structures. Although Web Science is interdisciplinary by nature, this
course will be focusing mainly on the computing aspects of the Web: how
it works, how it is used, and how it can be analyzed. We will examine
a number of topics including: web architecture, web characterization
and analysis, web archiving, Web 2.0, social networks, collective
intelligence, search engines, web mining, information diffusion on the
web, and the Semantic Web.

Prerequisites: Standing as an undergraduate senior, graduate student,
